  I am a PhD Candidate in Economics from the
    <a href="http://economics.mit.edu/">Massachusetts Institute
    of Technology (MIT)</a> in Cambridge, MA, USA.
    I will be on the Job Market in Fall 2021.

  I am a macroeconomist focusing on the economics of innovation, technology adoption,
    automation, and related taxation and labor market policies. I
    employ a mix of theoretical, numerical and empirical methods, relying on
    tools from both Macroeconomics and Labor Economics.

  I love teaching undergraduate classes and advising, which
  I had the chance to do when assisting in MIT's graduate class "Advanced
  Research and Communication".
