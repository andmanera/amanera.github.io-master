    Inventors are a scarce resource, whose skill sets can apply to R&D in disparate product markets. Motivated by this fact and by the fall in R&D productivity that characterized recent decades, I explore the impact of product market competition on the misallocation of inventors and growth. First, I delineate the boundaries of “knowledge markets”, employing USPTO patent data to group NAICS sectors that employ inventors with similar skills. Second, I analyze the relation between 4-digit NAICS sectors’ market concentration and their share of knowledge-market inventors. I establish that: (i) the last thirty years saw a sizable increase in the concentration of inventors across NAICS sectors of application; (ii) over the period 1997-2012, sectors with increasing concentration have captured rising shares of inventors; (iii) high-concentration sectors saw an increase in inventors at the top of the innovating firms distribution, a fall in forward citations, and a decrease in R&D productivity, as measured by growth in output per worker per inventor. Quantitatively, my estimates imply that inventor misallocation to less competitive sectors produced a 27% reduction in output per worker growth over the period 1997-2012 (-0.78pp in absolute value). I interpret my findings through a Schumpeterian model of creative destruction, where incumbents can conduct “defensive patenting” with the primary aim to erect barriers to entry for potential competitors. In the model, unbalanced increases in markups shift inventors towards less competitive sectors, and towards monopolistic firms carrying out defensive innovation, reducing R&D productivity and growth. A calibration of this model reveals that directing R&D subsidies to entrants in high-concentration sectors is the most effective policy to maximize productivity, raising annual GDP growth by 0.5pp (17% of the calibrated baseline).

    We study the economic incentives for automation when labor and machines are perfect substitutes. Labor may still be employed in production, even when it is a costlier input than robots on a productivity-adjusted basis. This occurs if firms face uninsurable idiosyncratic risk, adjusting the stock of machines is costly, and workers can be hired and fired quickly enough. Even though labor survives, jobs become less stable, as workers are hired in short-lived bursts to cope with shocks. We calibrate a general equilibrium, multi-industry version of our model to match data on robot adoption in US manufacturing sectors, and use it to compute the employment and labor share consequences of progress in automation technology. A fall in the relative price of robots leads to relatively few jobs losses, while reductions in adjustment costs, or improvements in relative robot productivity, can be far more disruptive. The model-implied semi-elasticity of aggregate employment to robot penetration ranges between 0.01% and 0.1%, depending on the underlying source of increased robot adoption. Adding reduced-form hiring and firing costs to our benchmark model reveals that the scare of automation is justified when regulations impose substantial rigidity on employment relations.

    We study the impact of employment protection legislation (EPL) on firms’
    innovation choices, through an event-study analysis of several labor market
    reforms occurring in Europe over 2000-2016.
    Data on firms’ technology adoption from the Community Innovation Survey
    reveal that substantial drops in EPL for temporary workers prompt a
    reallocation of innovation efforts towards the introduction of new products,
    away from process innovation aimed at cutting labor costs.
    Among innovative firms, the share of product innovators increases by 15%
    of the pre-reform value (10pp in absolute terms), while the share of firms
    specializing in process innovation falls by 35% (also 10pp).

    We argue that the US tax system is biased against labor and in favor of capital
    and has become more so in recent years. As a consequence,
    it has promoted levels of automation beyond what is socially desirable.
    Moving from the US tax system in the 2010s to optimal taxation of capital and
    labor would raise employment by 4.02 percent and the
    labor share by 0.78 percentage point and
    restore the optimal level of automation.
    If moving to optimal taxes is infeasible,
    more modest reforms can still increase employment
    by 1.14– 1.96 percent,
    but in this case it is also beneficial to impose an
    additional automation tax to reduce the equilibrium level of automation.
    This is because marginal automated tasks do not bring
    much productivity gains but displace workers,
    reducing employment below its socially optimal level.
    We additionally show that reducing labor taxes or combining
    lower capital taxes with automation taxes can increase employment
    much more than the uniform reductions in capital taxes
    enacted between 2000 and 2018.
